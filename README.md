Starting from the concepts of OOP, The Lord Of Java designs the architecture (back-end) of an extraordinary world, which contains clans of supernatural creatures that are grouped according to species, in so-called hordes. Each creature can gather resources necessary for growth of the horde.
Although each tribe has individual traits, all mystical creatures share many common traits. Abilities represent the essence of every fabulous being in the Java realm, characterizing the strength of each individual. The higher a character's personal skill values, the more feared he is and also the more likely he is to win a battle against a "weaker" enemy. Each species of fantastic creature will be associated with a horde. In other words, each horde will store only one type of character, given by the type parameter.
The tribes can scout each other army and get hints about the power of the enemy before deciding if they should attack or gather more resources. Once one of the clans start the battle, the mystical creatures will duel and the horde with the most duels won is the victorious one.
