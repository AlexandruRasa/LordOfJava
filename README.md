Starting from the concepts of OOP, The Lord Of Java designs the architecture (back-end) of an extraordinary world, which contains clans of supernatural creatures that live grouped according to species, in so-called hordes. Although each species has individual traits, all mystical creatures share many common traits. Abilities represent the essence of every fabulous creature in the Java realm, characterizing the strength of each individual. The higher a character's personal skill values, the more feared he is and also the more likely he is to win a battle against a "weaker" creature. Each species of fantastic animal will be associated with a horde. In other words, each horde will store only one type of animal, given by the type parameter.
